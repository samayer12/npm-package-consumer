# npm-package-consumer

This repo provides a minimally functioning example of how to use a repository that you publish.
Follow the lesson plan in [npm-package-demo](TODO LINK) for details.

## To run the consumer:

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm run dev`
3. Navigate to the localhost URL provided by terminal output
4. Observe the "Imported component" that is displayed on-screen.
5. Try chaning the dependency listed in the `package.json` for `@samayer12/npm-package-demo` to some other value.
6. Observe how the "Imported component" changes without you needing to make any changes to your implementation.
